base stand to hold fans under an HM90 Minisforum computer with 1 HDD installed

The Minisforum HM90 computer has a major flaw in that the lower half of the computer is not cooled with fans nor convection. I am seeing the temperature of my 4TB flash overheat along with the HDD. This riser/stand was built to hold two 40mm fans, each placed to generate airflow in opposite directions to help circulate air to remove heat from the flash heatsink and HDD.
